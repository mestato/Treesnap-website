Help our nation’s trees!  Invasive diseases and pests threaten the health of America’s forests. Scientists are working to understand what allows some individual trees to survive, but they need to find healthy, resilient trees in the forest to study.  That’s where concerned foresters, landowners, and citizens (you!) can help.  Tag trees you find in your community, on your property, or out in the wild to help us understand Forest health!

The TreeSnap app is a means for participants to record the location and health of particular tree species of interest.  Scientists use the collected information to locate candidates for genetic sequencing and breeding programs.   To learn more about the TreeSnap project, visit our website at https://treesnap.org/
