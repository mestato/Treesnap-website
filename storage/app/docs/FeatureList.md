# Features

## It's a snap
Come across an ash, hemlock, chestnut, or white oak in the woods?  Record it with TreeSnap and its geolocation will be shared with scientists to study it.

## Data collection
TreeSnap is easy to use.  Snap a photo, answer a few questions and be done in a couple of taps.

## Sync
Create an account and sync your observations with the TreeSnap server wirelessly.

## Contribute

Information reported in TreeSnap is used by real scientists.  That ash you've found might be the start of a completely new breeding program.

## Privacy

The GPS location of your trees is protected, and not revealed to outside parties.  Our map will only display the approximate location of each tree, or you can opt out of adding your data to the map entirely.  Only TreeSnap related research programs will have access to this information.

## Availability
TreeSnap is available for iOS and Android smart phones, and is *completely free.*
