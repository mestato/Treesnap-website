# The trees of TreeSnap

## American chestnut

American chestnut (_Castanea dentata_) was once a dominant tree in eastern North American forests but a deadly fungal disease wiped out most of these trees in the early 1900s.

### Chestnut blight
 Chestnut blight is caused by the fungus _Cryphonectria parasitica_.  It was introduced to North America in the early 1900s by accidentally importing infected Asian chestnut trees. Most Asian chestnuts are quite resistant to the fungus but American chestnut proved highly susceptible and by 1940 few mature chestnut trees were left.
          The fungus that causes chestnut blight grows in the vascular system of the tree, forming a canker and eventually girdling the tree. Symptoms of chestnut blight include cracked bark, sunken cankers, and fungal structures.
Several breeding programs exist to develop trees that are resistant to chestnut blight. Many of these rely of hybridizing American chestnuts with resistant Chinese of Japanese chestnuts and then back crossing to American chestnut. 
            Our hope is that this reporting app will let members of the public identify chestnut trees that have some natural resistance to chestnut blight.

## Elm

American elm (_Ulmus americana_)is a native species to North America that was once the dominant tree species along city and suburban streets. The American elm were known for their beautiful canopies and tolerance to poor soil conditions. After the introduction of Dutch elm disease in the 1930's, American elms have disappeared from the American cityscape.

### Dutch elm disease

Dutch elm disease is caused by a parasitic fungus (_Ophiostoma ulmi_) and is spread by elm bark beetles.  Fungal infection results in the tree plugging its own xylem tissue in an attempt to stop its spread.  This stops the flow of water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of the tree, killing it.

## Ash

There are several different species of American ash trees, all of which are susceptible to the deadly emerald ash borer.
 * White ash _Fraxinus americana_
 * Green ash _Fraxinus pennsylvanica_
 * Black ash _Fraxinus nigra_
 * Blue ash _Fraxinus quadrangulata_
        

### Emerald ash borer

An invasive insect, the emerald ash borer, is currently moving through North America and killing ash trees. The larvae of this beetle feed on the inner bark of ash trees, cutting off the tree’s flow of water and nutrients and eventually killing the tree. All American ash species are susceptible to the emerald ash borer and so far there is very little natural resistance to the insect in our trees.
          Our hope is that this reporting app will let members of the public identify ash trees that are lingering after the emerald ash borer’s arrival and which may have some natural resistance. Partners will then collect seeds from these trees and add them to tree breeding programs to try and propagate resistant trees that are not killed by the emerald ash borer to use in forest restoration.

## White oak

White oak (_Quercus alba_) is an extremely important tree species. It provides wood for lumber (including bourbon barrels) and is also a key food source for wildlife. It is a key component of the central hardwood forests. Mature white oaks typically grow very large, 80-100 feet high, and have broad, full canopies. White oaks can live a very long time and some trees have been found that are over 400 years old.

## Hemlock
American hemlock species are being killed by hemlock woolly adelgids.  Hemlocks are beautiful evergreen trees native to North America.  Many species of wildlife utilize hemlock stands as a habitat, and the trees are also popular ornamentals.

* Eastern hemlock _Tsuga canadensis_
* Carolina hemlock _Tsuga caroliniana_

### Hemlock woolly adelgid

This insect sucks the sap of hemlock trees, weakening trees, preventing new growth, and eventually killing trees. In addition, hemlock woolly adelgids are thought to inject a toxin when feeding that further damages hemlock trees by drying them out. Infested trees loose needles and branches and typically die 4-10 years after initial adelgid arrival unless treated.
The hemlock woolly adelgid’s name comes from the insect’s egg sacs, which hang from the undersides of branches at certain times of year and look like small woolly tufts. These insects are invasive in North America, introduced from Japan.
Our hope is that this reporting app will let members of the public identify hemlock trees that have some natural resistance to hemlock woolly adelgid.
