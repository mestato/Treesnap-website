# Frequently Asked Questions

### When will TreeSnap be available in the app store?

TreeSnap was released in July 2017.  It is available now for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.treesource) and  [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/treesnap/id1226499160?mt=8).

### Why are tree locations altered?

Some of the trees TreeSnap records are very valuable or are on private land. To protect the trees and the privacy of landowners, we do not display exact locations on our map.  Instead, locations are randomly altered and reported within a 5 mile radius.
 
 TreeSnap and our partner breeding programs have access to the original reported coordinates.  Prior to viewing or sampling any tree on private land, we will contact the owner of the land for consent.

### I reported a tree at x location, but it appears somewhere else.

We do not publicly display precise locations to protect the trees and individual landowner privacy.  Only administrators, or the logged in user who reported a tree, can see the precise location of a tree. You can also see the exact location you reported on your own mobile device.

 Rest assured, your data and the original accurate locations are stored and available for research groups so that you can help save these tree species!

### Is my data safe?
TreeSnap uses OpenSSL encryption to secure all of your data.  The exact locations of your trees are stored in an encrypted databases.  Only our partner organizations will be granted access to the exact location of trees you report in TreeSnap. 

### Are there training documents for using TreeSnap?

We are currently creating training material for using the TreeSnap app.  

In addition to these guides, we will be hosting virtual training sessions for using TreeSnap.  For more info, follow us on Twitter or [contact us](/contact).

### Does TreeSnap help me identify trees?

TreeSnap does not currently act as a tree identification guide.  The **Info** tab for each tree in the app provides key identification features for each species and can serve as a reference.  We hope to implement training in the future to help users learn to identify different tree species.
