# Frequently Asked Questions

### When will TreeSnap be available in the app store?

We currently plan to release TreeSnap by August 1st 2017.  If you are interested in participating in beta testing, or would like to collaborate with TreeSnap, please [contact us](/contact).

### Why are the tree reports showing up as a giant circle instead of a pin?

Some of the trees TreeSnap records are very valuable or are on private land. To protect the trees and the privacy of landowners, we do not display exact locations on our map.  Instead, locations are randomly altered and reported within a 5 mile radius.
 
 TreeSnap and our partner breeding programs have access to the original reported coordinates.  Prior to viewing or sampling any tree on private land, we will contact the owner of the land for consent.

### I reported a tree at x location, but it appears somewhere else.

We do not publicly display precise locations to protect the trees and individual landowner privacy.  Only administrators, or the logged in user who reported a tree, can see the precise location of a tree. You can also see the exact location you reported on your own mobile device.

 Rest assured, your data and the original accurate locations are stored and available for research groups so that you can help save these tree species!
