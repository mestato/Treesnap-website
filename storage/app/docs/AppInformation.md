## Get the App!
Participate in the TreeSnap project by downloading the mobile app for iOS and Android.  Register an account, go for a hike, and submit observations of American chestnut, hemlocks, white oak, and ash trees.  For each tree you find, take a photo and answer the questions prompted by the app.  **Please only submit observations for trees on public land, or land that you hold the rights to.**
  
The TreeSnap app is currently in **closed beta**. This means that an invite is necessary to download the app.  If you would like to participate, please contact Dr. Bradford Condon at <bradford.condon@uky.edu>.
  
The TreeSnap mobile app will be available for download on August 1st 2017.

## Get Trained

   TreeSnap is easy to use.  Download the app, register an account, take a hike and submit observations of trees you see along the way.  While we are particularly interested in certain tree species (chestnut, white oak, hemlock, ash), you can also submit information on other species.
   Additional in-person trainings for the TreeSnap app will be available in the fall of 2017 via the University of Kentucky.  Interested in scheduling training for your group or want to learn more?  Contact Dr. Ellen Crocker at <e.crocker@uky.edu>
