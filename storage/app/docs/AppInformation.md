## Get the App!
Participate in the Treesnap project by downloading the mobile app for iOS and Android.  Register an account, go for a hike, and submit observations of American Chestnut, Hemlocks, White Oak, and Ash Trees.  For each tree you find, take a photo and answer the questions prompted by the app.  **Please only submit observations for trees on public land, or land that you hold the rights to.**
  
The Treesnap app is currently in **closed beta**. This means that an invite is necessary to download the app.  If you would like to participate, please contact Dr. Bradford Condon at <bradford.condon@uky.edu>.
  
The Treesnap mobile app will be available for download on August 1st 2017.
